# Exersice 1. How many missing values are there in the dataset "economics" (from ggplot2)?


# Exersice 2. Check the type of variables in "economics"


# Exersice 3. Find observations from "economics" that

# relate to 2015

# relate to January (use nrow() to know, how many rows you have found)

# psavert >= 12 and pce > 600

# psavert < 5 or psavert > 12

# psavert between 10 and 13 (inclusive) - use between()


# Exersice 4. Which 5 rows of "economics" contain the highest unemploy values?
# What are these 5 unemploy values and corresponding dates?


# Exersice 5. Create "my_economics" as a copy of "economics". 
# Use mutate() to add a new column "year" (hint: see pr_visualization).
# View "my_economics" to make sure the column "year" has been added
# Compare two ways we used to create a column: this one and in pr_visualization. 


# Exersice 6.Use group_by() and summarise() to calculate mean number of unemployed per year in "my_economics" 
# Save the result in "year_unemploy" dataset

# Exersice 7. Use pipe to get the same result as in exersice 6
