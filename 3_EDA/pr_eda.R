# Exersice 1. Base on diamonds df, explore the distribution of price, try different binwidth. Make a conclusion



# Exersice 2. Base on diamonds df, explore the distribution of clarity and color



# Exersice 3. How many diamonds in diamonds df are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? 
# What do you think is the cause of the difference?


# Exersice 4. How many missing values are there in flights df?


# Exersice 5. What is the mean time of departure delay according to flights$dep_delay?
# What na.rm = TRUE does?



# Exersice 6. Base on flights df, make new df with additional variables: dep_hour, dep_min, dep_time_formatted
# Calculate dep_hour as dep_time %/% 100, dep_min as dep_time %% 100, dep_time_formatted as dep_hour + dep_min / 60
# Analyze variance of dep_hour and dep_time_formatted. 
# What happens with missing values (NA) in charts?



# Exersice 7. Base on flights df, discover covariance between dep_delay and arr_delay, 
# distance and arr_delay. Which charts are more demonstrative?



# Exersice 8. Base on flights df, discover covariance between carrier and cancelled flights (hint: add variable cancelled flights)



# Exersice 9. Base on flights df, discover covariance between carrier and dep_delay



# Exersice 10. Make eda for mpg df
